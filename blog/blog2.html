            <h2>an introduction to linux for the average user </h2>
        <p> --- expect this to be updated as time goes on. i will do my best. this is also my first time writing an extended article in a long time. expect errors. ---</p>
        <p> --- cites are noted in [brackets] --- </p>
        <p>To your average Windows or macOS users, the world of Linux may seem baffling or confusing at first. I will discuss some varying distributions, their various advantages and disadvantages, and other various facts about them to help simplify this. I’ll go through the different, for lack of a better term, “architecture” as put by user “Aman’ from the site codedamn puts it[1], of the varying Linux distributions. For simplicity's sake, I will refer to “Linux Distributions” as “Linux Distros”</p>
        <p>I’ll start with one of the major differences of Linux distros, and one that (could) change your experience dramatically. This difference is that of Package Managers, which varies between the distribution. Debian-based distributions used something called dpkg, which is generally interfaced through something called APT, or, the Advanced Package Tool, which, depending on your level of experience in the Linux world, you may be somewhat familiar with. We will use a tool called neofetch throughout this paper as an example. If you wanted to install neofetch using APT and a modern version of Debian, you would run the command; sudo apt install neofetch. [2] Breaking this down, the term sudo, refers to running an elevated command, think of running an application as an Administrator on a Windows machine. Apt, of course, refers to APT. Install, indicates to APT you want to install something. Neofetch, can be replaced with whatever package you want to install. In quite a few cases, these packages should be located in a repository, which is where the system would pull, or download the packages from. APT utilizes the .deb file format.[5]</p>
        <p>Some distributions use different package managers. Fedora, and also a few others, such as Red Had Enterprise Linux or CentOS, for example, uses dnf, though, commands may vary between the previously mentioned distributions. The difference between the two may seem different, but, while what you, the user, enters differs, what they do essentially remains the same. If you wanted to install neofetch on a system running Fedora, you would run the command; sudo dnf install neofetch. The meanings remain the same, except for dnf, which means you are telling dnf you want to install something. If you wanted to install neofetch on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL, you would need to go through more steps as neofetch isn’t in RHEL’s official repositories, you would need to enable a third party repository and then run the install command. Additionally, earlier versions[3] of RHEL and centOS use the command “yum” instead of “dnf”. dnf utilizes the file format .rpm.[5]</p>
        <p>Another commonly used package manager is called Pacman, the command for which is also called pacman, and it utilizes .tar.xz file formats, among others.[5] Pacman is utilized more on arch and arch-based systems. If we wanted to install neofetch on Arch, or most Arch-based systems, we would simply run the command pacman -S neofetch. Pacman, as usual, indicates we are telling pacman we wish to install something, and -S tells pacman we want to Synchronize packages[4]  and neofetch, indicates that we are installing neofetch.</p>
       <P>APT\dpkg, dnf, and pacman are what I would consider to be the three primary package managers, but they are more that are still used in popular distributions. I’ll cover a few here quickly. openSUSE, utilizes zypper, and uses the .rpm file format[5], same as dnf, and you would run the command sudo zypper install neofetch. Gentoo uses Portage[5], with the command emerge. To install neofetch, you will run the command emerge –ask app-misc/neofetch[6].</P> 
    <p>Moving onto something primarily used by end-user’s devices and not servers, is the Desktop Environment. There is countless different Desktop Environments, and an advanced user could install almost any desktop environment on their system that they wish. I’ll cover some of the primary ones used by the major distributions. And some ones you may not expect.</p> 
    <P>I’ll also note to readers that this may contain some of my own personal opinions, but I will make it very clear if it is.</P>
    <p>Starting off, is my most used, KDE (Plasma), used by many varying distributions, It offers a windows-like experience, with a bottom task bar, a start-menu like experience. KDE Plasma may also optionally include a selection of applications tailored to the theme. KDE Plasma is also used with other distributions like Canonical’s Kubuntu, a “flavour” Ubuntu, openSUSE comes with a version of KDE Plasma pre-installed, and there is KDE’s own KDE neon, based off of Ubuntu, others may include Manjaro KDE and Fedora KDE. Notably, Valve Corporation’s Steamdeck version of SteamOS utilizes a somewhat-customized version of KDE Plasma.</p>
    <p>There is also the standard of many big name distributors, GNOME. Gnome is used in RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, The non-steamdeck version of SteamOS and to an extent, the questionably named Pop!_OS. Gnome is similar to macOS in terms of layout, with a macOS-esque layout, with a activities bar on the bottom, and a taskbar located at the top. </p>
    <p>Another option is Xfce, which, while not as popular as the previous two, is used as an option by some distributions. It is included as a flavour for openSUSE and Manjaro, among others.[7]</p>
    <p>You also have other various smaller-name but still popular environments, like MATE, which offers a somewhat windows-like experience with, a taskbar and start-menu-like experience, as well with the more traditional windows-like bar at the bottom containing information on open applications.</p>
    <p>There is also Cinnamon, which is my second favourite Desktop Environment, which is included in various distribution flavours, like Void Linux, and Linux Mint, Cinnamon is primarily maintained by Linux Mint’s team, and is a fork of Gnome 2, and to me, seems to be the most windows-like experience, with a bottom taskbar, with a start-menu like experience, and a portion for active applications to be shown on the taskbar.</p>
    <p>Other “Unix-Based” systems use their own, sometimes, propriety environments, in example is macOS’s “Aqua” environment[7] and Chrome OS’s “Aura”[7].</p>
    <p>There is, all in all, many differences in the various distributions out there, and of course, may be differ extremely depending on the distribution. Some are extremely new-user friendly; some are nearly exclusively used by experienced users. Many people “distro-hop”, as in, hopping between distributions. And in the end, whatever distribution you may use on your device, is up to what you find you like. </p>
