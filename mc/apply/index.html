    <p>to apply, you should be an EVE Online player, and be in or blue to Winter Coalition. Alternatively, you must have a vouch from someone in the coalition, if you are not in the coalition or are in a hostile group.</p>
    <p>to be whitelisted, please contact autumn/sopris/molliey in-game or on discord. You must also follow the rules whenever joining.</p>
    <p>Loose - (don't share Opsec information. This won't get you removed from our server but it could get you removed for your alliance.) </p>
    <p>Full-Strict - Do not lag the server. Anyone found lagging the server in anyway is subject to being removed from the server, and (if you were vouched in) your vouch will also be removed. </p>
    <p>cnt.d - If a maximum of 4 people from one corporation are removed from the server, their entire corporation will be barred from the server.</p>
    <p>Loose-Strict - No PHinc or FRT-U, or any non-esi gated group members are permitted to join without a vouch.</p>
    <p>Follow your coalition, alliance, and corp rules.</p>
<p>Follow these rules: https://pastebin.com/TD590qn9</p>
<p>repeated violations of these rules will result in you being removed from the server, and reported to your appropiate alliance and corporation leaders.</p>
